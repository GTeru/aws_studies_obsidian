- After a [[Simple Queue Service (SQS)]] message is polled by a consumer, it becomes __invisible__ to other consumers
- By default, the "message visibility timeout" is 30 seconds
- That means the message has 30 seconds to be processed
- After the "message visibility timeout" is over, the message is __visible__ in SQS
- If a message is not processed within the visibility timeout, it will be processed __twice__
- A consumer could call the __ChangeMessageVisibility__ API to get more time
	- If visibility timeout is high (hours), and the consumer crashes, re-processing will take time
	- If visibility timeout is too low (seconds), we may get duplicates
