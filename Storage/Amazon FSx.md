- Launch 3rd party high-performances file systems on AWS
- Fully managed service
- Some supported File System
	- Lustre
	- Windows File Server
	- NetAPP ONTAP
	- OpenZFS
## File System Deployment Options
---
- Scratch File System
	- Temporary storage
	- Data is not replicated (doesn't persist if file system fails)
	- High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
	- Use case
		- Short-time processing
		- Optimize costs
- Persistent File System
	- Long-term storage
	- Data is replicated within same AZ
	- Replace failed files within minutes
	- Usage
		- Long-term processing
		- Sensitive data

## FSx Windows File System
---
- FSx for Windows is fully managed Windows file system share drive
- Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
- Microsoft Active Directory integration, ACLs, user quotas
- Can be mounted on [[EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)]] instances
- Supports Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) Namespaces (group file across multiple FS)
- Scale up to 10s of GBs, millions of IIOPS, 100s of data
- Storage Options
	- SSD - latency sensitive workloads (database, media processing, data analytics, etc...)
	- HDD - broad spectrum of workloads (home directory, CMS, etc...)
- Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect)
- Can be configured to be available in multiple [[Availability Zone (AZs)]]
- Data is back-up daily to [[S3]]

## FSx Lustre
---
- Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
- Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "Cluster"
- Machine Learning, High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Video processing, financial modeling, electrocnic design automation
- Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions IOPS, sub-ms latencies
- Storage options
	- SSD - low latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations
	- HDD - throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations
- Seamless integration with S3
	- Can "read S3" as a file system
	- Can write output of computations back to S3
- Can be used from on-premises serves (VPN or Direct Connect)
## FSx for NetApp ONTAP
---
- Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS
- File system compatible with NFS, CMB, iSCSI protocol
- Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS
- Works with
	- Linux
	- Windows
	- MacOS
	- VMware Cloud on AWS
	- Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
	- Amazon EC2, [[Elastic Container Service (ECS)]], [[Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]]
- Storage shrinks and grows automatically
- Snapshots, replication, low-cost compression and data de-duplication
- Point in time instantaneaous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

## FSx for OpenZFS
---
- Managed OpenZFS system on AWS
- File system compatible with NFS (v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2)
- Move workloads running on ZFS to AWS
- Works with
	- Linux
	- Windows
	- MacOS
	- VMware Cloud on AWS
	- Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
	- Amazon EC2, [[Elastic Container Service (ECS)]], [[Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]]
- Up to 1.000.000 IOPS with < 0.5 latency
- Snapshots, compression and low-cost
- Point in time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)
