- Protect your entire Amazon [[VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]]
	- Protection from layer 3 to layer 7
- You can inspect in any direction
	- VPC to VPC traffic
	- Outbound/inbound to internet
	- To/From [[DX (Direct Connect)]] & [[Site-to-Site VPN]]
- Internally, the AWS Network Firewall uses the AWS [[GLB (Gateway Load Balancer)]]
- Rules can be centrally managed cross-account by [[AWS Firewall Manager]] to apply to many VPCs
- Supports 1000s of rules
	- IP & port - example: 10.000s of IP filtering
	- Protocol - example: block SMB protocol for outbound communications
	- Stateful domain list rule groups: only allow outbound traffic to \*.mycorp.com or 3rd party software repo
	- General patter matching using __regex__
- Traffic filtering: Allow, drop or alert for the traffic that matches the rules
- Active flow inspection to protect against network threats with intrusion-pervention capabilities (like GLB, but maanged by AWS)
- Send logs of rule matches to Amazon [[S3 (Simple Storage Service)]], [[CloudWatch Logs]], [[Kinesis Data Firehose]]
