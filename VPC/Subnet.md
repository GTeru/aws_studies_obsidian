- Sub range of IPs
- AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
	- These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance
	- If a [[CIDR]] block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are
		- 10.0.0.0 - Network address
		- 10.0.0.1 - reserved by AWS for the [[VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]] router
		- 10.0.0.2 - reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
		- 10.0.0.3 - reserved by AWS for future use
		- 10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. AWS oes not support broadcast in a VPC, therefor the address is reserved
- Tip: If you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances
	- You can't choose a subnet of size /27 (32 addresses, `32 - 5 (reserved) = 27 < 29`)
	- You need to choose a subnet of size /26
