- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many [[EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)]]
- EFS works with EC2 instances and in multi [[AZ (Availability Zone)]]
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (average 3x gp2), pay per use
- Use cases
	- Content management
	- Web serving
	- Data sharing
	- Wordpress
- Uses [[Security Groups]] to control access to EFS
- Compatible with Linex based [[AMI (Amazon Machine Image)]] (not windows)
- Encryption at rest using [[KMS (Key Management Service)]]
- POSIX file system (~Linux) that has a standard file API
- File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning!

## Performance & Storage Classes
---
- EFS Scale
	- 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+/s throughput
	- Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically
- Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time)
	- General Purpose (default) - latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc...)
	- Max I/O - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
- Throughput Mode
	- Bursting - 1TB = 50 MiB/s + burst of up to 100 MiB/s
	- Provisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size. ex: 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage
	- Elastic - automatically scale throughput up or down based on the current workload
- Storage tiers (lifecycle management feature - move file after N days)
	- Standard: for frequently accessed files
	- Infrequent access (EFS - IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. Enable EFS - IA with a Lifecycle Policy
- Availability and durability
	- Standard: Multi [[AZ (Availability Zone)]] great for prod
	- One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone - IA)
- Over 90% in cost savings
