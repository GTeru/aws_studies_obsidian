After creating a user and giving it's necessary capabilities (via [[IAM]]) by either adding him to a user group or attaching a custom policy to him, the user has some options to manage AWS:
1. AWS Web Console (web navigator) - more user friendly and designed to less "TI friendly" users. It just needs to log into the console via a web navigator.
2. AWS CLI  - Command Line Tool that accesses AWS APIs, it's more useful for developers and system managers. First the user needs to create an access key and configure the CLI into the machine
3. AWS Cloudshell- A combination of 1 and 2, where the user has a CLI environment that is accessed via the AWS Web Console, it gives the user capabilities of the AWS CLI without having to install in the machine or make configurations in it. 
It's important to note that methods 2 and 3 have the same capabilities that are attributed to the user that is configured !
