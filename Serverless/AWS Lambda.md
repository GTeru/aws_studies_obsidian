## Main AWS Service Integrations Examples
---
- [[API Gateway]] - create API that invokes Lambda functions
- [[Kinesis]] - make data transformations
- [[DynamoDB]] - create triggers on database that invokes a Lambda function
- [[S3]] - invokes Lambda function on image uploads
- [[CloudFront]] - with Lambda@Edge
- CloudWatch Events - invoke Lambda functions on infrastructure alarms/triggers 
- [[SNS (Simple Notification Service)]] and [[SQS (Simple Queue Service)]] - invoke Lambda on new SNS topics or SQS message is created/pushed
- [[Amazon Cognito]] - react when user logs into the system
