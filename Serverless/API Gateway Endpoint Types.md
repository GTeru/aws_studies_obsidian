- Edge Optimized (default): Global clients
	- Requests are routed through the [[CloudFront]] Edge locations (improves latency)
	- API Gateway still lives in only one [[AWS Region]]
- Regional
	- For clients within the same region
	- Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strategies and distribution)
- Private
	- Can only be accessed from your [[VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]] using an interface VPC endpoint ([[ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)]])
	- Use a resource policy to define access
