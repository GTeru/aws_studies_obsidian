- [[Simple Queue Service (SQS)]] and [[Simple Notification Service (SNS)]] are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols for AWS
- Traditional applications running on-premises may use open protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- When migrating to cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use cloud-native solutions, we can use Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ
- Amazon MQ has some differences over SQS and SNS
	- Doesn't scale as much
	- Runs on servers, can run in multi-[[Availability Zone (AZs)]] with failover
	- Has queue feature and topic feature
- High availability is setup by creating different Amazon MQ Broker instances in differents AZs, one active instance and another standby instance, both of them are backeup by an [[Elastic File System (EFS)]]. When the active instance fails for some reason, messages failover to the standby instance.
