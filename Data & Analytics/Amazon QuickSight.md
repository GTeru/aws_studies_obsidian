## Dashboard & Analysis
---
- Define users (standard versions) and Groups (enterprise version)
	- These users & groups exist within QuickSight, not [[IAM]]
- A dashboard
	- is a really-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share
	- preserves the configuration of the analysis (filtering, parameters, controls, sort)
- Share analysis or the dashboard with Users or Groups
- To share a dashboard, you must first publish it
- Users who see the dashboard can also see the underlying data
